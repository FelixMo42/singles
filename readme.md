# The Experiment

When a player would make a move that would make it impossible for them to win or cause them to lose the computer will tell them that they are making a bad move and give them an opportunity to not make it along with an explanation. The type of explanation given for each participant will be randomly assigned from the following list:

* **simple:** stop them and give them a simple and true explanation of why their move makes it impossible to win or would cause them to lose.
* **complex:** stop them and give them a complex and true explanation of why their move makes it impossible to win or would cause them to lose.
* **plasuble lie:** stop them and give them a simple but false plausible explanation of why their move makes it impossible to win or would cause them to lose.
* **absurd lie:** stop them and give them a simple but absurd explanation of why their move makes it impossible to win or would cause them to lose.

This is testing how much people trust computers and how much the nature of the explanation given by the computer factors into it.

# Hypothses

**H1:** The participants will find the robot with a simple justification more “human” resulting in a trusting relationship between the robot and the participant (i.e. the participant will be more likely to believe and follow the instructions of the robot.)

**H2:** The participants will be unlikly to fact check the robot at first, but upon realization of one the robot’s mistake they will be less likely to listen to the robot from then on.

**H3:** The participants will not trust the robot and will be less likely to follow its advice.

# The Game

**Goal:** black out number such that:
* no number appears twice in any row or column.
* no two black squares are adjacent.
* the white squares form a single connected group (connections along diagonals do not count).
