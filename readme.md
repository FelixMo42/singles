# The Expirement

When a player would make a move that would make it immposible for them to win or cause them to loose the computer will tell them that they are making bad move and give them an oppertunity to not make it along with an explenation. The type of explination will be randomly assigned from the fallowing list:

* **simple:** stop them and give them a simple and true explanation of why their move makes it impossible to win or would cause them to loose.
* **complex:** stop them and give them a complex and true explanation of why their move makes it impossible to win or would cause them to loose.
* **plasuble lie:** stop them and give them a simple but false plausible explanation of why their move makes it impossible to win or would cause them to loose.
* **absurd lie:** stop them and give them a simple but absurd explanation of why their move makes it impossible to win or would cause them to loose.

This is testing how much people trust computers and how much the nature of the explenation given by the computer factors into it.

# Hypothses

**H1:** Most participants will not check to see if the explenation given is true when the explenation seems plasuble.

**H2:** Participants will be less likeley to take the advise when it seem unlikly to be true.

**H3:** Participants will be equally likely to exept the explanation when its simple as when its complecated.

# The Game

**Goal:** black out number such that:
* no number appears twice in any row or column.
* no two black squares are adjacent.
* the white squares form a single connected group (connections along diagonals do not count).
